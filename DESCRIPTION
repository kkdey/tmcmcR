Description: This package performs fast Transformation based Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo (TMCMC),Transdimensional Transformation based Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo (TTMCMC), Adaptive versions of RWMH and TMCMC, along with MC3 (Metropolis
    Coupled MCMC) and R-MC3 (Randomized MC3) and R-TMC3 (Randomized Transformation
    based MC3) meant for use in case of multimodal target densities.
