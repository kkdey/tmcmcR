Description:  This package performs fast Transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC), Transdimensional
Transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TTMCMC), Adaptive versions of RWMH and TMCMC, along with
MC3 (Metropolis Coupled MCMC) and R-MC3 (Randomized MC3) and R-TMC3 (Randomized Transformation based MC3)
meant for use in case of multimodal target densities. The package also contains convergence and mixing measures of the chains so as to compare the limiting
behavior.
